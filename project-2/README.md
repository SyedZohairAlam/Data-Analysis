Titanic Dataset Analysis 📊
Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis project! This Jupyter notebook explores the Titanic dataset to show how passenger ages relate to survival using a colorful histogram. It's a simple and fun way to learn data analysis with Python! 🐍
📋 What This Project Does
This project uses the Titanic dataset to create a stacked histogram. The histogram shows the ages of passengers who survived the Titanic disaster compared to those who didn't.

Dataset: titanic_data.csv (includes passenger info like age and survival status)
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
Visualization: A stacked histogram of ages for survivors (green) and non-survivors (orange)

🚀 How to Get Started
Follow these easy steps to run the project on your computer:
What You Need 🛠️

Python 3 (version 3.11 works best)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Python libraries:
Pandas (pip install pandas)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)



Setup Steps ⚙️

Download or clone this project folder.
Make sure titanic_data.csv is in the same folder as titanic dataset analysis.ipynb.
Install the needed libraries:pip install pandas matplotlib


Start Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook titanic dataset analysis.ipynb



Running the Code ▶️

Open titanic dataset analysis.ipynb in Jupyter.
Run the cell to:
Load the dataset 📂
Create a stacked histogram 📈


You'll see a chart showing the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

📈 What the Code Shows
The code does these things:

Loads the Data: Reads titanic_data.csv using Pandas.
Creates a Histogram: Shows ages of survivors (green) and non-survivors (orange) in a stacked chart.
Makes It Clear: Uses labels, a title, and a grid to make the chart easy to read.

The histogram helps you see if younger or older passengers were more likely to survive.
📂 Files in This Project

titanic dataset analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook with the code.
titanic_data.csv: The dataset with Titanic passenger details.

🖼️ What the Chart Looks Like
The stacked histogram shows:

Green bars: Passengers who survived.
Orange bars: Passengers who didn’t survive.
X-axis: Age (in years).
Y-axis: Number of passengers.

This makes it simple to compare survival across age groups.
