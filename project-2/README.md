Titanic Data Analysis 📊
Welcome to the Titanic Data Analysis project! This Jupyter notebook explores the Titanic dataset to understand passenger survival patterns using data visualization, like histograms. It's a simple way to learn about data analysis with Python! 🐍
📋 Project Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to create a stacked histogram showing the age distribution of passengers who survived and those who didn't. It helps visualize how age might relate to survival on the Titanic.

Dataset: titanic_data.csv (contains passenger details like age, survival status, and more)
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
Main Visualization: A stacked histogram comparing ages of survivors and non-survivors

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project on your computer:
Prerequisites 🛠️

Python 3 installed (version 3.11 recommended)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed
Python libraries:
Pandas (pip install pandas)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)



Installation ⚙️

Clone or download this project folder to your computer.
Ensure the titanic_data.csv file is in the same folder as the notebook (Class 6.ipynb).
Install the required libraries:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib


Open the Jupyter notebook:jupyter notebook Class 6.ipynb



Running the Notebook ▶️

Open Class 6.ipynb in Jupyter.
Run each cell in order to:
Load the dataset 📂
Display basic info about the data ℹ️
Create a stacked histogram 📈


The final cell will show a chart comparing the ages of survivors and non-survivors.

📈 What the Code Does
The notebook does the following:

Loads the Data: Reads titanic_data.csv using Pandas.
Explores the Data: Shows the dataset's structure and checks for missing values.
Visualizes Ages: Creates a stacked histogram to compare the age distribution of passengers who survived (green) and those who didn’t (orange).

The histogram helps you see if certain age groups were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster.
